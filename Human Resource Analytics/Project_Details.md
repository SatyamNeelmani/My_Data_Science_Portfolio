Steps for Project
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 2: Baseline Models Without Oversampling and Without Feature Engineering
Step 3: Baseline Models Without Feature Engineering and SMOTE
Step 4: Baseline Models With Feature Engineering
Step 5: ANN Models (No SMOTE) With and Without Feature Engineering
Step 6: Top N Models Tuned and Tested with Cost Sensitive 
Step 7: Hyerparameter Tuning of Final Models
Step 8: Ensembling Frameworks
Step 9: Exploring other models to improve ensemble framework.
