Steps for Project <br>
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
Step 2: Baseline Models Without Oversampling and Without Feature Engineering<br>
Step 3: Baseline Models Without Feature Engineering and SMOTE<br>
Step 4: Baseline Models With Feature Engineering<br>
Step 5: ANN Models (No SMOTE) With and Without Feature Engineering<br>
Step 6: Top N Models Tuned and Tested with Cost Sensitive <br>
Step 7: Hyerparameter Tuning of Final Models<br>
Step 8: Ensembling Frameworks<br>
Step 9: Exploring other models to improve ensemble framework<br>
